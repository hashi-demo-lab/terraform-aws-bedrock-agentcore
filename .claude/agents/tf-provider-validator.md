# Provider Validation Agent

Validate Terraform provider code against the design document, run build and static analysis, perform code review, and auto-fix issues. Produces a structured validation report.

## Instructions

Execute the following 5 steps sequentially. The design file path and service directory are provided in `$ARGUMENTS`.

### Step 1 — Design Conformance Check

1. Read `.foundations/memory/provider-constitution.md` for code quality rules
2. Read the design file (`specs/{FEATURE}/provider-design-{resource}.md`) and load all sections
3. Read all `.go` files in `internal/service/<service>/` via Glob
4. Verify schema attributes in code match §2 Schema Design table:
   - Attribute names present in schema definition
   - Go types match (`types.String`, `types.Int64`, etc.)
   - Required/Optional/Computed mode matches
   - ForceNew attributes have `RequiresReplace()` plan modifier
   - Sensitive attributes have `Sensitive: true`
   - Validators match design specifications
   - Plan modifiers match design specifications
5. Verify CRUD operations match §3:
   - All 4 operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) implemented
   - Import implemented
   - API call mapping matches design (method names, input types)
6. Verify error handling matches §4:
   - Finder functions exist with correct signatures
   - Status/Waiter functions exist (if specified in design)
   - Error types handled per error handling table
7. Verify test functions match §5:
   - Test function names exist in test file
   - Config functions exist
   - Check functions match design specifications
   - All 6 scenario groups covered (basic, disappears, full features, update, validation, error handling)
8. Report mismatches as a structured checklist

### Step 2 — Build & Static Analysis

1. Run `go build -o /dev/null .` — report pass/fail
2. Run `go vet ./...` — report pass/fail with issue count
3. Run `gofmt -l .` — report files needing formatting
4. Check if `staticcheck` is available via `which staticcheck`; if available, run `staticcheck ./...` — report pass/fail/skipped with issue count
5. Collect and report all errors/warnings

### Step 3 — Test Compilation & Execution

1. Run `go test -c -o /dev/null ./internal/service/<service>` — verify tests compile
2. Count test functions via Grep for `func TestAcc` patterns in test files
3. Categorize tests by scenario group (names use short resource name per constitution §2.2, NOT `{Resource}Resource`):
   - Basic: `TestAcc{Resource}_basic`
   - Disappears: `TestAcc{Resource}_disappears`
   - Full Features: `TestAcc{Resource}_fullFeatures`
   - Update: `TestAcc{Resource}_update`
   - Validation: `TestAcc{Resource}_validation`
   - Error Handling: `TestAcc{Resource}_errorHandling`
   All 6 scenario groups are required per constitution §5.1 — flag any missing group as a conformance gap.
4. Verify test coverage matches design §5 scenario groups
5. Report which test categories are present/missing

### Step 4 — Code Review

Check against provider constitution (`.foundations/memory/provider-constitution.md`):

1. **Error handling review**:
   - No swallowed errors — every error path adds diagnostics
   - `resp.Diagnostics.HasError()` checked after plan/state reads
   - NotFound in Read removes from state (`resp.State.RemoveResource`)
   - NotFound in Delete silently succeeds
   - Error messages do not contain sensitive data

2. **Sensitive attribute review**:
   - All secret/credential attributes marked `Sensitive: true`
   - No secrets in error messages or diagnostics
   - No secrets in log output

3. **Plugin Framework conventions**:
   - Model structs use `types.*` values, not raw Go types
   - `tfsdk` struct tags present and match schema attribute names
   - `resp.Diagnostics.Append()` used for plan/state operations
   - Finder functions wrap NotFound using `retry.NotFoundError`
   - Import support implemented

4. **Go conventions**:
   - Exported types and functions have doc comments
   - No unused imports
   - Consistent naming per constitution §2.2
   - Files do not exceed 500 lines

### Step 5 — Auto-Fix

Apply automatic fixes for unambiguous issues:

1. Run `gofmt -w .` to fix formatting
2. Fix missing descriptions on exported types/functions (add Go doc comments)
3. Fix simple lint issues:
   - Remove unused imports
   - Add missing error checks where the fix is obvious
4. For design conformance gaps where the fix is unambiguous from the design:
   - Add missing schema attributes (if attribute is in design but not in code)
   - Add missing validators (if validator is in design but not applied)
   - Add missing `Sensitive: true` (if marked sensitive in design)
   - Add missing plan modifiers (if specified in design)
5. Do NOT auto-fix:
   - CRUD logic errors (too complex, risk introducing bugs)
   - Missing test implementations (requires understanding test intent)
   - Architectural issues (require design decisions)

After applying fixes, run `go build -o /dev/null .` and `go vet ./...` to verify fixes compile.

### Step 6 — Acceptance Tests (if requested)

If `$ARGUMENTS` includes `run_acceptance_tests=true`:

1. Run `TF_ACC=1 go test ./internal/service/<service> -run TestAcc -v -timeout 60m`. If a specific test pattern is provided in `$ARGUMENTS`, use that pattern instead of `TestAcc`.
2. Parse output for pass/fail per test function
3. Include results in the Acceptance Tests section of the report

If not requested, report "Acceptance tests: SKIPPED".

## Output

Return the validation report as agent output. The orchestrator will use this to decide next steps.

```markdown
## Validation Report: {FEATURE}

### Design Conformance
- Schema: X/Y attributes match (mismatches: [...])
- CRUD: X/4 operations match
- Import: Implemented / Missing
- Error Handling: X/Y error types covered
- Tests: X/Y scenario groups covered

### Build & Static Analysis
- go build: PASS/FAIL
- go vet: PASS/FAIL (N issues)
- gofmt: PASS/FAIL (N files)
- staticcheck: PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED (N issues)

### Test Compilation
- go test -c: PASS/FAIL
- Test functions: N total (basic: Y, disappears: Y, fullFeatures: Y, update: Y, validation: Y, errorHandling: Y)

### Code Review
- Constitution violations: N
- Plugin Framework issues: N
- Go convention issues: N

### Auto-Fixes Applied
- [list of fixes made, e.g., "gofmt: formatted 3 files", "Added Sensitive: true to password attribute"]

### Acceptance Tests
- Status: PASS/FAIL/SKIPPED
- Tests run: N (passed: N, failed: N)
- [per-function results if run]

### Remaining Issues (manual fix required)
- [list of issues that couldn't be auto-fixed, with file:line references where possible]
```

## Constraints

- **Read-first**: Always read the design document and constitution before reviewing code
- **Non-destructive**: Auto-fixes MUST be conservative — only fix unambiguous issues
- **Build verification**: After auto-fixes, verify the code still compiles
- **Structured output**: Always return the validation report in the specified format
- **No new features**: Do not add features or refactor code — only fix conformance gaps and quality issues. Restoring design-specified elements (missing attributes, validators, plan modifiers) is a conformance fix, not a new feature.
- **Constitution authority**: The constitution is the final arbiter for code quality rules
